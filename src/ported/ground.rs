// provenance: moved from physis-core src/ground.rs (core HEAD d65858b)
// as part of the Core/Product split, 2026-09-14. One implementation; no fork.
//! Common ground — the conceptual state a human and a machine both work on.
//!
//! ## What this is for
//!
//! A person and an agent working on the same problem normally share nothing but
//! prose. Each re-derives what the other already established, each states
//! conclusions without the evidence that produced them, and neither can tell
//! later which claims were actually tested. Fluent output substitutes for
//! evidence because there is nowhere else for evidence to live.
//!
//! This module renders the place it lives. Not a report *about* the work — the
//! **state of the work**: what is currently believed, what it rests on, what
//! contradicts it, what was predicted and never scored, and what changed when.
//!
//! Both sides write to the same store through the same commands
//! (`hypothesis create/evidence/transition`, `contradiction record`), so the
//! view is shared by construction rather than by synchronisation.
//!
//! ## What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! - **No model is involved.** Nothing here embeds, generates, ranks or scores
//!   with a network. It reads persisted state and arranges it. Physis's claim
//!   is to be the common ground, not another voice in the conversation.
//! - **It does not resolve contradictions.** Open ones are shown open, with
//!   both parties and both sources. A view that quietly picked a side would be
//!   destroying the one signal a disagreement carries.
//! - **It does not summarise.** Every line is a record that exists, rendered.
//!
//! ## The three questions it answers
//!
//! 1. **What do we believe, and how hard did it earn that?** Claims by standing,
//!    with evidence counts — supporting *and* contradicting, never netted into
//!    one number.
//! 2. **What are we still disagreeing about?** Open contradictions, both sides.
//! 3. **What did we promise to check and never check?** Open predictions with
//!    their age. This is the section that makes the state honest: a claim with
//!    an unresolved prediction from three weeks ago is not settled, however
//!    confident its wording.

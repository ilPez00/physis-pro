// provenance: moved from physis-core src/bin/physis.rs (core HEAD d65858b) by
// the 2026-09-14 Core/Product split. The multi-edition front door is product
// routing (it advertises and forwards to a commercial product); Core kept a
// minimal single-edition forwarder for a day, then dropped its own `physis`
// bin entirely (2026-09-15) once this one was wired back in as the one
// shipped `physis` executable (see root Cargo.toml `[[bin]] name = "physis"`,
// `src/bin/physis.rs`). `system`/`quality`/`studio` moved off `CORE_COMMANDS`
// below in the same pass: all three are Pro-only now.
//! `physis` — the single front door to whichever Physis edition is installed.
//!
//! Physis ships as two executables with forty-odd subcommands between them, and
//! nothing told a newcomer which one to type. This binary is the answer to
//! `physis -h`: one help screen covering both halves, which says plainly what is
//! installed, what is not, and how to get the rest.
//!
//! It owns no subcommands of its own beyond `upgrade`. Everything else is
//! forwarded, unparsed, to `physis-core` or `physis-pro` — deliberately, so this
//! file never has to be updated when either of them grows a command, and so
//! their `--help`, exit codes and stdio behave exactly as if invoked directly.
